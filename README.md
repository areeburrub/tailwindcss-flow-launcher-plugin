## Installation

This plugin is written in Typescript, so you need Node.js installed to use it (but you probably have it installed if you want to search npm plugins).

### Install Node.js

To install Node.js, go to https://nodejs.org/ and download the LTS (Long Term Support) version. Alternatively, you can use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) (or [nvm-windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows)).

### Install the plugin

You can find this plugin in Flow's Plugin Store, or by running this command in Flow Launcher:

```
pm install tailwindcss
```
